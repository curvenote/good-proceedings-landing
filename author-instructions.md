Speakers at the GOOD Conference are invited to submit a [full-length article](#articles) to be included in the conference proceedings as well as deposit their [slides or poster](#slides-and-posters) for inclusion in the proceedings.

# Articles

Articles can be submitted in one of the following formats:

* MyST Markdown
* LaTeX
* Microsoft Word (DOCX)

For the best experience with the submission system and to be able to easily preview the web-based format of your article while you are writing we recommend using MyST or LaTeX. 

## MyST Markdown

MyST Markdown is a flavor of Markdown that has been extended for technical writing. It's possible to write your entire submission in MyST Markdown, Which will be used to create your web-based article and a PDF version. More information MyST Markdown see https://mystmd.org. 

If you choose to submit using MyST Markdown you will be making your submission via GitHub, knowledge of Git and GitHub-based fork, PR and review workflows is required.

To make your submission follow the instructions on the proceedings GitHub repo: https://github.com/curvenote/good-proceedings.

## LaTeX

Although we can accept submissions in LaTeX, the build system for your article will convert this to HTML using MyST Markdown. MyST allows markdown (`.md`) and/or `.tex` files to be used interchangeably in your article, so you can write in LaTeX while using the `myst` and `curvenote` command line tools to build and preview your article. Find out more about LaTeX support in MyST Markdown here: https://mystmd.org/guide/writing-in-latex.

If you choose to submit using MyST Markdown or LaTeX you will be making your submission via GitHub, knowledge of Git and GitHub-based fork, PR and review workflows is required.
