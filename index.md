This 4-day in-person event, which took place from March 17-20, 2025, provided a unique platform for attendees to engage with experts, share insights, and explore advancements in Open OnDemand â€” a groundbreaking tool that offers web-based access to supercomputing resources. With a focus on collaboration and innovation, GOOD featured keynote talks, lightning sessions, and networking opportunities designed to empower participants to drive the future of remote supercomputing access.

All presenters at GOOD 2025 have the opportunity to contribute an article, or simply their slides and posters, to the GOOD Conference Proceedings. These proceedings will extend the reach of the GOOD Conference so anyone can read, cite, and build on the work from the conference.

Open OnDemand is a web-based platform that provides easy remote access to supercomputing resources, enabling users to run advanced computing tasks from any device with a browser. Developed by the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), it eliminates the need for client software installation, allowing students, researchers, and industry professionals to compute from anywhere. Open OnDemand is designed to simplify supercomputer access with a user-friendly interface, offering powerful virtual computing labs across various disciplines.
