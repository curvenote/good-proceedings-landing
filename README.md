# GOOD Proceedings Landing Page Content

This repository is a Curvenote site that provides the non-article pages of the [GOOD Proceedings site](https://good-proceedings.curve.space). The content on `index.md` will appear on the homepage, below the hero banner. If additional pages are added to this project (and to `toc` in the `curvenote.yml` file), they will be available on the proceedings site as well, and they may be exposed as navigation links in the site settings.

Github actions are set up to automatically deploy this content from the `main` branch of this repository.
